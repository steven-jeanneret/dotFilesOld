The <code><strong>Node.appendChild()</strong></code> method adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node. If the given child is a reference to an existing node in the document, <code>appendChild()</code> moves it from its current position to the new position (there is no requirement to remove the node from its parent node before appending it to some other node).
